### Mandatory introduction
I make useful things, useless things, and things to make you smile.

#### Support my web experiments
Help support my projects and buy me a coffee via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/defaced) or sponsor me on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/workeffortwaste/).

If my fun web experiments brighten your day, my tools save your bacon, or you simply want to say thanks for the work that goes into [SEOslides.page](https://SEOslides.page), [TAPEFEAR](https://www.tapefear.com/), or any of my [other projects](https://defaced.dev/) consider supporting me and helping to fund more.
