### Mandatory introduction
I make useful things, useless things, and things to make you smile.


#### Support my web experiments
Help support my projects and sponsor me on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/workeffortwaste/).

If my fun web experiments brighten your day, my tools save your bacon, or you simply want to say thanks for the work that goes into [SEOslides.page](https://SEOslides.page), [TAPEFEAR](https://www.tapefear.com/), or any of my [other projects](https://defaced.dev/) consider supporting me and helping to fund more.

#### Horseman üê¥üëÄ

As a thank for you sponsoring me you'll get immediate early access (for as long as you remain a sponsor) to Horseman, a unique customisable web crawler that I've been working on in my spare time for the last year.
